Krystart is a single-threaded init system for Linux 2.6+, designed to be useful yet small
and unintrusive. It uses a declarative configuration style. It is a fork of Epoch init system.

It has no dependencies whatsoever other than glibc, and /bin/sh is strongly recommended
but can be disabled with --disable-shell.

It supports process supervision, service status, autorestarting, stderr/stdout redirection,
user/group setting, and much more.

Krystart is public domain software. See UNLICENSE.TXT for more details.
